# 🚨 Police Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing police stop-and-search data to uncover meaningful insights about law enforcement patterns and behavior. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

---

## 📁 Project Name

`05_Sub_Project_Police_dataAnalysis`

---

## 🎯 Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on police dataset and answer key questions such as:

- What types of violations are most common?
- Do certain demographics get stopped more frequently?
- What outcomes (e.g., arrests) are most likely, and under what conditions?

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `Police_datasets_Analyzing.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all steps of analysis and visualizations.
- `police_dataset.csv` – The raw dataset used for analysis.

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in Analysis

- Data Cleaning:
  - Removed null and irrelevant columns.
  - Formatted data types for analysis.
- Data Exploration:
  - Analyzed patterns in gender, race, violation type, and search outcomes.
  - Investigated stop durations and their relationship to violations.
- Visualization:
  - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for plots such as bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
