# 🚔 Police Data Analysis Project

This project is part of a sub-module under data analysis practice. The goal is to analyze a dataset related to police stop-and-search operations and uncover insights using Python and data analysis techniques.

---

## 📁 Project Name
`05_Sub_Project_Police_dataAnalysis`

---

## 📊 Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on police-related data and extract actionable insights using Python libraries such as:

- `Pandas` for data manipulation
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization
- `NumPy` for numerical operations

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `Car_subProject_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis and visualizations
- `Car_datasets.csv` – CSV dataset used for analysis

---

## 🧪 Key Analysis Done

- Data Cleaning: Handling nulls, dropping unnecessary columns
- Insight Generation: Patterns in stops based on gender, race, reason, etc.
- Visualizations: Graphs that depict trends and summaries
- Grouping & Aggregation: Used to summarize and compare key metrics

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open the `Car_subProject_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to view the analysis and insights.
